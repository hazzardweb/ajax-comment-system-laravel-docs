## 2.0.0-beta.1 (2017-03-13)

The script has been rewritten from scratch. It now uses a iframe to embed the comments so it doesn't interfere anymore with the app you're using the comments in. The script now requires Laravel 5.3+.

New Features:

- Bootstrap 4
- Embed via iframe
- Comment reports
- Comment preview
- Support for commentable models
