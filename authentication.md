# Authentication

<hr>

Laravel Comments uses the [Laravel Authentication](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authentication) driver to determine if the user is authenticated.

If you don't have the Authentication setup, Laravel has that coverd for you, see [Authentication Quickstart](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authentication#authentication-quickstart). All you have to do is register some routes and copy some views.

For the [demo](http://demo.hazzardweb.com/laravel-comments) I've customized the login and register pages a little bit.
If you are interested in those views check out the [Laravel Comments Demo](https://github.com/hazzardweb/laravel-comments-demo) repository on GitHub. Just make sure to create that `comments` folder in your `app` directory and copy the files as described in the [Installation](installation.md) section.
