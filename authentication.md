# Authentication

<hr>

Laravel Comments uses the [Laravel Authentication](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authentication) driver to determine if the user is authenticated.

If you don't have the Authentication setup, Laravel has that coverd for you, see [Authentication Quickstart](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authentication#authentication-quickstart). All you have to do is register some routes and copy some views.

You can find the [demo](http://laravel-comments.demo.hazzardweb.com/) setup on [GitHub](https://github.com/hazzardweb/laravel-comments-demo). Just make sure to create that `comments` folder in your `app` directory and copy the files as described in the [Installation](installation.md) section.
